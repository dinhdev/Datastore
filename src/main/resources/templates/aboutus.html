                        <p>DataExo is the business data shopping platform. It sells financial data, marketing data, medical and hospital data, real estate data, and many other data sets.
                            The objective of DataExo is providing one stop shop for all business data. To fulfill this goal, DataExo develops and supports data marketplace platform. On this platform, data vendors can upload, update, visualize and distribute data to data consumers, and consumer can search and find the data they need, subscribe to the data, and download the data.
                        </p>

                        <p>DataExo retail and DataExo marketplace are two channels to see and buy data. DataExo retail is the channel that DataExo company sells data. DataExo marketplace is a collection of independent data retails and vendors who sell their data on the DataExo system. Typically, DataExo retail does not compete with market place vendors.
                            If data consumer does not find certain data in DataExo system, he can post request on the platform, data vendors or DataExo will acquire the data.
                        </p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">The Power of DataExo</h4>
                        <p>DataExo Marketplace and DataExo Retail play a big part in providing all those every day and hard to find data sets. DataExo Marketplace is a collection of independent retailers and vendors who sell their data through the DataExo system. These retailers use DataExo web services, such as data ETL (extraction, transformation, loading), data management, data visualization, data analysis and data API, and in return pay DataExo a percentage of the data sets sold. Very often, the Marketplace retailers can go beyond borders to tap new markets by selling their data throughout the world via DataExo web infrastructure.</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">The DataExo Experience</h4>
                       <p>Importantly, the  DataExo consumer experience is the same whether data are sold directly from DataExo or a 3rd party via the Marketplace. They’re designed to be: DataExo wants its users to have a consistent user experience, so all Marketplace sellers fit seamlessly into the DataExo system. The data set pages, the subscription and download options, and the checkout process are all largely the same consumer experience. It’s only different on the back end — who’s offering the data, who’s getting paid, who’s doing the data maintaining and update, and so on.
                           So, in many cases, data consumers won’t even know they’re buying from a Marketplace seller, or DataExo, unless they watch carefully.
